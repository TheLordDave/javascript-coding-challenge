# Project Name

## Overview

This project provides a simple web application with login/logout functionality, image display, and modal interactions. It includes a front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and interacts with a mock backend server to handle authentication and image retrieval.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Getting Started

To run the project, you'll need to start two Python servers. Follow the instructions below to set up and start the servers.

### Starting the HTTP Servers

1. **HTML Server**

   This server serves the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files required for the frontend of the application.

   - **Script Name:** `html-server.py`
   - **Command to Run:**
     ```sh
     python html-server.py
     ```
   - **Alternative:** Double-click the `html-server.py` file to run it.

2. **Mock Web Server**

   This server provides mock endpoints for login, logout, and status checking. It simulates backend API responses.

   - **Script Name:** `server.py`
   - **Command to Run:**
     ```sh
     python server.py
     ```
   - **Alternative:** Double-click the `server.py` file to run it.

### Running the Project

1. **Start the HTML Server:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `html-server.py`, and run:
   ```sh
   python html-server.py
   ```

2. **Start the Mock Web Server:**

   Open a new terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `server.py`, and run:
   ```sh
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You should see the application's frontend.

## Usage

- **Login:** Use the login form to authenticate. On successful login, you will be redirected to the appropriate page with user-specific content.
- **Logout:** Click the logout button to log out from the application.
- **Image Grid:** The image grid will display different images based on the login state.

## Troubleshooting

- **Server Not Starting:** Ensure that Python is installed and properly configured in your system's PATH.
- **Network Issues:** Verify that both servers are running and that no other application is using port 8000.

### Key Points in Formatting:

- **Headings**: Use `#` for the main title and `##` for subsections.
- **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks and inline code with single backticks (`).
- **Links**: Use markdown syntax for links and email addresses.
- **Lists**: Use hyphens (`-`) or asterisks (`*`) for unordered lists.
- **Commands**: Use code blocks for commands and instructions.
